# ft_printf - Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() arenâ€™t enough
This project involves recreating the printf function from the standard C library. The goal is to understand the functionality behind the printf function, which is widely used for formatted output in C programming. My custom implementation replicates the core functionalites of the original printf function.

It can handle these format specifiers: %c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %p, %x, %X and %%.
